This is pulling into the wall. Moves the shoulder from a flexed to an extended position. Moves the scapula from a protracted to a retracted position. Doesn't necessarily need to be trained if vertical pulling is trained, could be done minimally. Plays well with underclings, helps with steeper overhangs.
### Muscle Groups 
- Trapezius and Rhomboids
	- Under significant stress, amount of stress is main difference from vertical pulling
- Biceps  
	-  Heavily involved to flex the elbow
- Lats
	- Heavily involved for shoulder extension 
## Exercises

### Dumbbell Row
Go heavy with these, about 60-80% of your pullup strength, counting your body weight. You can add a brief pause to help with lock offs. If its primary, go for 5-6 reps. Work up to 10 or 12 reps, then add weight and drop reps
#### Form
One hand on bench, with elbow locked. Outside leg forward, right around shoulder length if not a bit wider. Weight just inside of your foot, back relatively horizontal. Keep your back flat, with neutral or slightly externally rotated position (think undercling), pull up to belly button. Let scapula protract, initiate motion with scapular retraction. Don't get force from rotating trunk. pull the elbow back. You can experiment with the arm angle.
