### Cuban Rotations
Go light with barbell or dumbbells, 10 to 12 reps. Think about driving through your wrists, steering with them. Don't pull back or go with the traps. 
#### Form
Grab the barbell/dumbbells, hold them above your head with elbows at 90, and rotate them down in front of you 90 degrees. Make sure your elbows need to stay in position, keep everything engaged. Go only as far as is comfortable. If you are feeling good, don't shrug your back but try to drop it down past 90 degrees towards your stomach with your scapula. Keep scapula set and back flat, tiny hip tilt.
