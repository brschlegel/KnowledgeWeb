###  Dips
Can do on rings to get a bit more good instability. Keep the rep ranges low, 4-6.
#### Form
Put the rings at chest level, tuck your knees. Suck shoulder blades together at the top, stay vertical, only go as far as you can control and are comfortable. Don't let your midback arch. Lock your wrists out a bit.
