## Exercises

#### Pullups
Broadly best for this, as its purely pulling vertically. There is some variation as you get steeper terrain. As soon as you are able, you should do some assisted one-arms. "Able" being defined as doing about +50% body weight.
#### Variations
- Shoulder width
- Wide Grip
- Chin up
In general, if you are going to do one, do a slightly wider weighted pull up. Go right around 90 degrees on your elbow. Think proud chest, keep your stomach tucked and tight, chest pointed to the sky. Go for 4 to 6 reps.
