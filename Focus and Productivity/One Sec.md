One sec is an app that forces you to pause and take a deep breath before you can continue to select apps, like Twitter or TikTok. I've found it incredibly helpful for kicking habits of sitting around mindlessly scrolling Twitter. 
## Previous Attempts to fix
---
Previously, I had tried deleting the apps, but I found I would just substitute what they did with much worse sources (Google news, Youtube shorts). I also felt that I may be missing things, and being on twitter and tiktok can be fun at times! There's also the fact that, really, there isn't a problem with scrolling twitter on the toilet. So after that I tried putting an app timer on, I would only be allowed to use the app for an hour a day. This just led to me wasting all the time I had on the app in the morning, and then following similar behaviors to deleting the app in the afternoon. 
## The Root of the Problem
---
None of these fixes addressed the root of my problem: sometimes I would pull out my phone to check twitter or tiktok, and end up scrolling for an entire hour, wasting all that time. It was nearly automatic; when finishing a task ([[Task Transitions]]), while cooking, laying down, etc. The second boredom struck, I was on my phone. The problem was the instinct to pull out my phone, and the low barrier to entry once I have pulled it out. 
### The Fix
One Sec makes me take a breath, for like 5 seconds, and then confronts me with a screen asking if I  **REALLY** want to open the app. It increases the barrier to entry, and gives me time to make a conscious decision against opening social media. After using it for a couple weeks, I began to see how little content was actually worth seeing, particularly on twitter. 
### Replacement
Something I'll do to fill time while unreal is loading or in the bathroom is Chess Tactics instead. I feel better doing this as its an active puzzle rather than blankly staring at a screen. In addition, tactics tend to have a fairly defined end point in time. Eventually, I'll get bored and move on with my day.
