## Monitors
Is 4K worth it? Yes
**Refresh rate:** How many times per second the display is able to draw a new image. 144Hz is a good number, 240 seems to be a high end option.
**Response time:** The amount of time it takes for pixels to change from one color to the next. 1 ms is a good number, 5ms seems to be the standard. Probably won't notice the difference between 5ms and 1ms, some answers are saying there isn't a real difference at all. 
**Curvature:** I like my curved monitor, not really sure how huge of a difference it makes but its worth looking at
**Resolution:** Currently both my monitors are 1080p, which is fine, but would be nice to try and upgrade. Probably will depend on my graphics card, but jumping to 1440p may be a nice upgrade 
**What I want:** Probably want a 1440P 144Hz Curved monitor if I can find one

## Graphics Card
**Memory:** Stores image data, ensures smooth and even execution of graphics display. 12GB should be plenty
