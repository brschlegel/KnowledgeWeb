# Description 
Game 5 had to be an RPG with very strict requirements. The requirements got quite into the minutia, including how many enviornments there could be, equipable items, etc. Our game was an RPG based on color mixing, where damage done was modified by how close the attacker's color is to the defender.

## Brainstorming
I mean it being an RPG did narrow things down pretty well, so it wasn't too hard to come up with something. Alex was in my group, and a project I knew he had done work on had alot to do with colors, so the idea kinda just sprang from there. I sort of assumed there would be a good way to mix colors in an intuitive way, which was a mistake. That being said, it was a novel concept that I was happy with

## Design
The color mixing was not very intuitive, leading to the feature not being used that much. Color matching also wasn't really that easy to tell what was going on, so people kinda just kept clicking. Balancing the swatches was also difficult, especially with color matching and mixing being had to get a grasp on. With an RPG, if this was going to be more than a prototyping game I would have to get mathematical with the balancing. Very interesting idea, but really hard to get right in practice

## Development
I spent the first week of the project reading color science papers trying to figure out a way to mix colors like paints. In the end I got something, but it wasn't perfect. The combat system was a huge mess though. Part of that was that I rewrote things like 10 times, and didn't spend the time that I should have planning it out. I think this was one of those moments it might have been better to just scrap what I had and start anew. Dealing with actions relating to input like this is annoying as there are a bunch of ways the input can be combined to produce novel results. As such, when doing these systems I should plan out much more ahead than I do for other systems, as the chance of weird edge cases is higher.

## Everyone lost their damn minds
Everyone else in the class really mentioned that this game was terrible to make, incredibly stressful and just ill-formed. I'll agree that the restrictions kinda stunk and were very strange, but it wasn't totally awful. It definitely helped that I was on a team with Destiny, who is a goddamn workhorse. She also handled basically every other system, while I dealt with just the combat and color systems.
