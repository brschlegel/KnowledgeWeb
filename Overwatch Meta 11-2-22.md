# It's super stale 
Nearly every team runs Sojourn, Reaper, Winston, Kiriko, and Lucio. Doesn't matter the game mode, defense vs attack. Changes are very small when they actually happen (ie: Roadhog vs Winston). Everyone on the team has pretty good movement, helps to rush back after death for many pushes. Very helpful to disengage as well.

### Sojourn
Character is just super good. Can spray damage into tanks, and with the railgun charge can get headshot picks. Grenade threatens any squishies and makes people split up. Incredible movement, can be anywhere at any time. Pretty much just the best DPS, doesn't surprise me every team has one. Almost seems like sniper battles between them every team fight, tide turns on a sojourn pick. Winston's often pop ult as a counter to sojourn ult. 
### Reaper
Tanks are important for many many reasons, and reaper can shred them. Also pretty damn independent, doesn't really need much heals. Teleport is good for positioning. Death blossom is also just flat good ult when everyone has to stick together so much.
#### External notes
Reaper is good for disrupting the enemy team, he grabs attention by flanking to start of team fights
### Winston
Got the shield to partition the space or block off a Reaper ult. Big jump movement to dive on supports or away from DPS. Seems like the movement is the main reason to go with Winston
#### External notes
Same with reaper, he can grab attention and get quick picks on squishies
### Kiriko
Once again movement is king. The ability to teleport to teammates helps kiriko keep up with Winston, and the whole invulnerability thing is always super good
### Lucio
Being able to increase speed to disengage is very helpful, and Lucio is just good in general.

# Super off-meta (?) picks on Junkertown!
Did not last long at all lol. About halfway through the match everyone changes back to the standard comp. Maybe it was because the map is so open at the start?

## No alt strategies?
