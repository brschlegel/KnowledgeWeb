## Rigidbodies
Rigidbodies often seem like a good idea when making character controllers. It'll handle the physics, and we can get realistic behaviors for cheap. Often though, your character isn't doing all that much physics, and the cost of fighting with the rigidbody isn't worth the benefit. On [[ThatDamnGoat]] we used a rigidbody for character movement, and regretted it all the time. We had issues with adding coyote time, issues with players ramping over edges, etc. When you get that realistic behavior for cheap, you are allowing systems you didn't design or fully understand a large amount of influence over the movement of your character.
