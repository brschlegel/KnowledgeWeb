# Box2D
Box2D is a physics library for games with many different bindings but I have used C++. Can be really tricky to work with, but has pretty much everything you will need. 

## Graphics
Box2D offers no graphics at all, so its very important to hook it up to a graphics library and test it extensively to make sure things line up.

## Collisions
The Shape part of the library is also very helpful for collisions even if you aren't doing any physics simulation. Takes a bit of learning to use but afterwards is very simple.
