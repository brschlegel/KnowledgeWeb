## GDScript
---
GDscript is a python like scripting language built into the engine. Its alright, dynamic typing sucks, and its a whole new thing to learn. I don't like python, so chances of loving this seem slim
### Static Typing
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html
Static GDScript, while it looks harder, is way better to use. Getting auto-complete, especially when dealing with an engine thats unknown to you is very helpful, and I prefer static typing anyway. Ran into an issue where I could not declare an array as a type because of what I believe was a circular dependency. Nicer than C++ because I can just make it dynamic, but still not really a fan of that.
## CSharp
---
Old reliable. I love CSharp, its always done what I needed and sits at just the right level of abstraction. Many of the arguments against it are kinda like "Oh people try GDScript and love it!" or "CSharp is harder to program in", but honestly I have close to no problems with C# to begin with, so there isn't a learning curve there.
### Finding Help
Its definitely a bit difficult to find good documentation on how the language functions within Godot, but oftentimes I can find GDScript examples and with some help with intellisense figure it out from there. Godot 4 seems like it has upgraded the CSharp experience quite a bit.
