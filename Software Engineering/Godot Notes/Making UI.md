## Anchors
Anchors are seemingly useless to use, as changing them does nearly nothing. It seems like they are there as a backbone for the engine, but they really want you using containers. I even saw a feature request to pretty much get rid of them as an option in the inspector and scripting language
## Containers
Containers are like the alignment components of Unity, but they have expanded on the idea quite a bit. There are containers for aligning things, adding margins, splitting things, etc. Everything I would be using anchors for in Unity is actually done with a container. An upside is that it requires less of a learning curve on how anchors work (Although I already went through that baptism by fire). Downside is that using anchors I could both include margins and a vertical alignment of children using anchors, but with containers, they are seperate nodes. This makes UI Trees very deep and dense; not a huge deal, but can be frustrating. Another quirk is that the actual values for how a child reacts to a parent container's alignment is actually defined by the child itself. Not sure how useful it is to have children differ in their rule following but its nice to have the option, if a bit tedius to have to update every childs settings seperately.
