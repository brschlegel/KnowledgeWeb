Instancing is like instantiating in Unity. It is how nodes can use packed up scenes (prefabs). Really important to recognize the difference between a script and scene here. You can add a node of the type of a script, but a scene is the actual prefab type object that you want. Instancing also creates the scene in memory, but must be added in add_child to actually do appear in the world.
