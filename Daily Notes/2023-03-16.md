## Risk Aversion
---
Today I had the thought that many problems I considered to be separate; My inability to commit to climbs, my general unwillingness to play chess and not totally loving board games, may actually have a shared aspect of risk aversion. With climbing its pretty clear, but with chess and board games it manifests in avoidance of the entire activity. I've had previous thoughts on these problems being ego related, which is definitely a part of it, but not the whole story. I seem to percieve board games and chess having really high stakes, and I believe its my ego raising these stakes. I don't want to be percieved, really by myself, as being stupid, or as not reaching my expectations, and as such the safest move is to not play. As such, there are two strategies here to  combat these factors. You can lower the stakes, in this case by controlling the ego, conciously reminding yourself that you know nothing, or you can become more comfortable with some risk. These two strategies are by no means mutually exclusive or completely separate. Becoming secure enough in your intelligence that you understand one game does not define your skill both allows you to take more risks and lowers the stakes. Becoming more comfortable with risk is necessary as well, as the risks in climbing are definitley real. Or, atleast the physical risks. You still need to conquer the obsession with yours and others expectations.
